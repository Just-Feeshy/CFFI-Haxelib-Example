# CFFI-Haxelib-Example
An example library to learn how to create a custom NDLL for your Haxe project using both Haxe and C++. This are the same bindings I use for [Spoopy Engine](https://github.com/Project-Ever-Changing/spoopy).

## Requirements
[Lime](https://lib.haxe.org/p/lime/)


## Building

    cd backend
    haxelib run hxcpp Build.xml
